DESCRIPTION				       *MultiWordComplete-description*

The built-in insert mode completion completes single words, and one can copy
the words following the previous expansion one-by-one. (But that is cumbersome
and doesn't scale when there are many alternatives.)
This plugin offers completion of sequences of words, i.e. everything separated
by whitespace, non-keyword characters or the start / end of line, based on the
typed first letter of each word. With this, one can quickly complete entire
phrases; for example, "imc" completes to "insert mode completion", and "/ulb"
completes to "/usr/local/bin".

SEE ALSO								     *

- CamelCaseComplete (vimscript #3915) provides a similar completion, but the
  anchor characters must be the start fragments of CamelCaseWords or
  underscore_words.
- CustomKeywordComplete (vimscript #0000) provides a similar completion with
  arbitrary anchors inside a single word.
- Check out the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

==============================================================================
USAGE						     *MultiWordComplete-usage*

In insert mode, type all initial letters of the requested phrase, and invoke
the multi-word completion via CTRL-X w.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.
								  *i_CTRL-W_w*
CTRL-X w		Find matches for multiple words which begin with the
			typed letters in front of the cursor. The 'ignorecase'
			and 'smartcase' settings apply. If no matches were
			found that way, a case-insensitive search is tried as
			a fallback. (So, unless you care about a minimum
			number of matches and search speed, you can be sloppy
			with the case of the typed letters.)
			The sequence of words can span multiple lines;
			newlines are removed in the completion results.

			Non-alphabetic keyword characters (e.g. numbers, "_"
			in the default 'iskeyword' setting) can be inserted
			into the completion base to force inclusion of these,
			e.g. both "mf" and "mf_b" complete to "my foo_bar",
			but the latter excludes "my foobar" and "my foo_quux".
			An alphabetic anchor following a non-alphabetic anchor
			must match immediately after the non-alphabetic
			letter, not in the next word. Thus, mentally parse the
			base "mf_b" as "m", "f", "_b".
			In addition, non-alphabetic keyword characters match
			at a start of a word, too. For example, "f2s" matches
			both "foobar 2000 system" ("2" matching like an
			alphabetic character) and "foo2sam" ("2" matching
			according to the special rule for non-alphabetic
			characters).

INSTALLATION				      *MultiWordComplete-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim MultiWordComplete*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				      *MultiWordComplete-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin (vimscript #3914).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				     *MultiWordComplete-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

		 *b:MultiWordComplete_complete* *g:MultiWordComplete_complete*
Analoguous to the 'complete' option, you can specify which buffers will be
scanned for completion candidates. Currently, '.' (current buffer), 'w'
(buffers from other windows), and 'b' (other listed buffers) are supported. >
    let g:MultiWordComplete_complete = '.,w,b'
The global setting can be overridden for a particular buffer
(b:MultiWordComplete_complete).

					   *g:MultiWordComplete_FindStartMark*
To disable the removal of the (mostly useless) completion base when aborting
with <Esc> while there are no matches: >
    let g:MultiWordComplete_FindStartMark = ''
<
						     *MultiWordComplete-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(MultiWordComplete) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script (e.g.
in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-x>w <Plug>(MultiWordComplete)<Plug>(MultiWordPostComplete)
<

TODO						      *MultiWordComplete-todo*

IDEAS						     *MultiWordComplete-ideas*

- Allow '.' wildcard for a single and '*' for multiple words.
- When whitespace before base, include trailing non-keywords in matches, else
  when non-keywords before base, stop at last keyword character in matches?
